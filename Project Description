# 🌐 Establishing Secure VPC Peering in AWS

## **Project Overview**  
This project focused on **creating a secure, private communication channel** between two VPCs using **VPC Peering**. The goal was to allow data transfer without exposing traffic to the internet, reinforcing AWS networking fundamentals.

## **Project Highlights**

### **What I Did:**  
🔧 **Created Two VPCs with Public Subnets**  
- Set up two separate **VPCs** in AWS, each with its own **public subnet**.

🔁 **Established VPC Peering Connection**  
- Configured **VPC Peering** to enable **direct communication** between VPCs.

🛣️ **Updated Route Tables**  
- Modified **route tables** in both VPCs to allow **bidirectional traffic flow** between peered networks.

🖥️ **Launched EC2 Instances and Verified Connectivity**  
- Deployed **EC2 instances** in both VPCs and successfully tested private IP communication between them.

## **Why This Matters?**  
VPC peering provides a **secure, low-latency method** for transferring data between AWS environments **without traversing the public internet**, helping ensure **data security and performance**.
